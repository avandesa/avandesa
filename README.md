Hi, I'm a software developer based in Indianapolis. I graduated from Purdue University in the Class of 2020 with a B.S. in Computer Science. I specialized in Systems Programming and Programming Languages. My favorite language is Rust, but I'm also skilled with C, Javascript, and Python.

[My homepage](https://avandesa.dev) has more information about my career and experiences.

Most of my projects are hosted [on Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/avandesa).
